# What is Git?
Git is a version control system.  It keeps a running history of our project, allowing
us to view or roll back to previous snapshots.

Git also provides branching, which lets us experiment with new features without
fear of breaking the main branch.

Git is also a collaboration system.  It lets us push our changes to a central
repository, and pull other peoples' changes from it.

When these three features are combined and used properly, it significantly smoothes
the development process.  But, if used incorrectly, it can cause major headaches.
This guide is intended to teach some good practices and keep everyone on the same
page.
