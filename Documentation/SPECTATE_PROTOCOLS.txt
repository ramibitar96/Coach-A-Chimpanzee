If you are logged in as a coach and you currently have a partner, you can send a GET request to 
localhost:3000/get_student_match

The server will authenticate your session token, checking to see if you're indeed a coach and
that you indeed have a partner.  If either of these things aren't true, it will respond with an
error code.  Otherwise, continue.

The server will then look up your parter's name and query riot's API.  It will then return a
JSON object directly from RIOT's API telling you everything you need to know about your student's
game.
