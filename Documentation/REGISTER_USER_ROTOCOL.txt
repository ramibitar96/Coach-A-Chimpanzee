# Registering a new user

To register a new user, the client should send a POST request over HTTPS.
The request's body should be a JSON object with the following format:

{
	"username": <username>
	"password": <password>
	"email": <email address>
	"summoner_id": <summoner id, as a number>
}

Do not bother encrypting the password yourself; HTTPS will encrypt all
packets for us.

The server will then reply with a JSON object of the following format:

{
	"error_code": <result code>
}

"error_code" is a number(NOT a string) specifying the result of the
operation.  See the following table to learn what each error code means.

| Error code	| Meaning 					|
|---			|---						|
| 0			 	| successful (no error)		|
| 1				| username already exists	|
| 2				| email address invalid		|
| anything else	| currently unused			|
