To get the data needed for history.html, send a GET request to localhost:3000/get_history

It will reply with an array of JSON objects looking like this:
{
  		user1:    <string>
  		user2: 	  <string>
  		log:	  <string>	// The whole chat log all in one giant string LMAO
  		draw_log:  <array of something, idk what>
 		game_data: <probably a JSON object from RIOT's API.>
}

If there's any kind of error on the server side, it will just send back null.
Error codes are tedious.
