# Retrieving Preferences

To retrieve the user's preferences, the preferences page should send a GET request
to "localhost:3000/get_prefs".  The request should include the session token cookie,
although I'm pretty sure the browser automatically does that.

The server will respond with a JSON object of the following format:
    {
        "error_code": <error code>,

        "user":
        {
            "summoner_name": <summoner name>,
            "current_rank": <their rank, an integer from 0 to 6>    // NOTE: we should probably get this from Riot.
        },

        "student":
        {
            "twitch": <user's twitch username>
            "skills": <an array of booleans>
            "min_coach_rank": <minimum rank of coach, an integer from 0 to 6>
        },

        "coach":
        {
            "replay": <a boolean indicating whether or not the coach wants to watch a replay instead of live game>
            "skills": <an array of booleans>
            "max_coachee_rank": <max rank of student, an integer from 0 to 6>
        }
    }

## What is the "skills" array?

Each element in the array coresponds to a skill, such as freezing, macro play, etc.
If the entry is true, that means the user has selected that skill.  Here is the list of skills
and their indices:

    const SkillIDEnum =
    {
        EVERYTHING: 0,
        LAST_HITTING: 1,
        MACRO: 2,
        MAP_AWARENESS: 3,
        SKILL_SHOTS: 4,
        FREEZING: 5,
        MATCHUPS: 6,
        SET_UP: 7
    };
(that was just copy/pasted from skillEnum.js)

So, if you receive the array
    [
        false,
        true,
        true,
        false, 
        false, 
        false, 
        false, 
        false
    ]
that means the user selected LAST_HITTING and MACRO, and no others.

## Relevant error codes:
| Error code    | Meaning                   |
|---            |---                        |
| 0             | successful (no error)     |
| 5             | session token expired     |
| 6             | session token invalid (IE: fake) |


# Changing preferences

To update the user's preferences, the client should send a POST request to
"localhost:3000/set_prefs".  As always, the session token cookie should be included.

The body of the request should be a JSON object just like the one described in the
above section(minus the "error_code" field).

The server will respond with a JSON object of the following format:
    {
        "error_code": <take a guess at what this contains.>
    }

## Relevant error codes:
| Error code    | Meaning                   |
|---            |---                        |
| 0             | successful (no error)     |
| 3             | json object did not contain the required fields    |
| 5             | session token expired     |
| 6             | session token invalid (IE: fake) |
