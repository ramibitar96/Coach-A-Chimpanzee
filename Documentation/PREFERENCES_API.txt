# Retrieving Preferences

To retrieve a user's preferences, the preferences page should send a GET request
to "localhost:3000/get_prefs".  The request should include the session token cookie,
although I'm pretty sure the browser automatically does that.

The server will respond with a JSON object of the following format:
    {
        "error_code": <error code>,

        "user":
        {
            "summoner_name": <summoner name>,
            "current_rank": <their rank, an integer from 0 to 6>    // NOTE: we should probably get this from Riot.
        },

        "student":
        {
            "last_hitting": <bool>,
            "macro": <bool>,
            "map_awareness": <bool>,
            "skillshots": <bool>,
            "freezing_waves": <bool>,
            "matchups": <bool>,
            "setup": <bool>,
            "min_coach_rank": <minimum rank of coach, an integer from 0 to 6>
        },

        "coach":
        {
            "last_hitting": <bool>,
            "macro": <bool>,
            "map_awareness": <bool>,
            "skillshots": <bool>,
            "freezing_waves": <bool>,
            "matchups": <bool>,
            "setup": <bool>,
            "max_student_rank": <max rank of student, an integer from 0 to 6>
        }
    }
