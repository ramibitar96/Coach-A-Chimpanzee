# Sending messages
To send a message from the client, simply call the "send" method on your socket object, with the message you want
to send as the parameter.

# Receiving messages on the client.

When your partner sends you a message, your socket will receive the 'message_received' event.
The event takes as a parameter an object that looks like this:
{
    "sender": <username of sender>,
    "contents": contents of the message
}
