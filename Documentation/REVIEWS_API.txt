# Adding a review

To add a review for your coach, send a post request to "http://our.domain.name:3000/add_review".
The request's body should be a JSON object of the following form:

{
    "rating": 1,   // A number between 1 and 5, inclusive
    "text": "Awesome coach, but I downvoted him because he's not a Pixar character"
}

As always, a cookie should be attached containing the student's session token.  The server will
look up the correct coach.


# Getting all reviews for a coach

To get all the reviews for a given coach, send a get request to 
"http://our.domain.name:3000/get_reviews?coach=mike_wizowski"

Obviously, replace "mike_wizowski" with the username of the coach.

The server will reply with a JSON object of the following form:

{
    "reviews":
    [
        {<a review object>},
        {<another review object>},
        {<etc.>},
        {<you get the picture>}
    ]
}

An individual review object has the following format:
{
    "author":   <username of the author of the review>,
    "date":     <A Javascript Date object representing the date the review was written>,

    "upvoteOrDownvote": <true if upvote, false if downvote>,
    "text":     <the text contents of the review>
}
