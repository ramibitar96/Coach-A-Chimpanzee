If you send a GET request to http://<our_domain_name>/get_profile?user=<username> , the server will
respond with a JSON object of the following format:

{
    "error_code": 0,

    "user":
    {
        "twitch_name": <user's twitch username>
        "current_rank": <their rank, an integer from 0 to 6>    // NOTE: we should probably get this from Riot.
    },

    "reviews":
    [
        {<a review object>},
        {<another review object>},
        {<etc.>},
        {<you get the picture>}
    ]
}

error_code is 0 on success.  Otherwise, see errorCodes.js

If there is an error, then error_code is the only entry in the
object.

An individual review object has the following format:
{
    "author":   <username of the author of the review>,
    "date":     <A Javascript Date object representing the date the review was written>,

    "rating":   <number between 1-5>
    "text":     <the text contents of the review>
}

This is simply a partial mix of get_prefs and get_reviews.
