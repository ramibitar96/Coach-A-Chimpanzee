* First, make sure Node.js is installed.

* Next, navigate to the "Back End" folder.

* Run "npm install" to download all of the dependencies, if you haven't already.
	* Any time a new package is installed(ie: when a new dependency is added to project.json), you'll need to run this.
	* This is because the packages are not stored in the repository.  See "GIT-GUIDELINES.md" for more information.

* Run "node index.js" to start the server.
